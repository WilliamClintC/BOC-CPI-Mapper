# Patent-Centrality-FactorModel

Using CRSP data from WRDS and Global Corporate Patent Dataset from UVA Darden. We consider a new factor called "Patent Intensity", which is the number of issued patents divided by market capitalization. 
We also consider anothe factor called "Centrality", which is the node centrality of a given asset with respect to other assets. We incorporate these factors into the Fama-French 5 factor model to create
a 7 factor model.
